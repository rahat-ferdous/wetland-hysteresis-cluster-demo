# Behaviour-based Classification of Wetlands: Hysteresis Clustering Demo

A demonstration of the concept of **Functional Hysteresis Types** for wetland methane emissions.

## 🎯 Research Concept

This demo explores whether wetlands can be classified by their dynamic methane emission behavior (hysteresis patterns) rather than traditional static classifications (bog, fen, marsh). The hypothesis is that a marsh in Alaska might share functional characteristics with a bog in Scandinavia based on similar underlying biophysical processes.

## 🚀 Live Demo

The app is deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud: https://wetland-hysteresis-cluster-demo.streamlit.app/

## 📊 What This Demo Shows

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic wetland hysteresis characteristics
2. **Clustering Analysis**: Uses K-means to identify emergent functional types
3. **3D Visualization**: Compares traditional vs. functional classification
4. **Cross-region Analysis**: Identifies similar patterns across different biomes
