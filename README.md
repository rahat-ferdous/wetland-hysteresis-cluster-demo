# Functional Wetland Types: Hysteresis Clustering Demo

A Streamlit web application demonstrating the concept of **Functional Hysteresis Types** for wetland methane emissions, as proposed in my research interests.

## 🎯 Research Concept

This demo explores whether wetlands can be classified by their dynamic methane emission behavior (hysteresis patterns) rather than traditional static classifications (bog, fen, marsh). The hypothesis is that a marsh in Alaska might share functional characteristics with a bog in Scandinavia based on similar underlying biophysical processes.

## 🚀 Live Demo

The app is deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud: [Your deployment link will go here]

## 📊 What This Demo Shows

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic wetland hysteresis characteristics
2. **Clustering Analysis**: Uses K-means to identify emergent functional types
3. **3D Visualization**: Compares traditional vs. functional classification
4. **Cross-region Analysis**: Identifies similar patterns across different biomes

## 🛠️ Technical Setup

To run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wetland-hysteresis-demo.git
cd wetland-hysteresis-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
